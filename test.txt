Generative AI-Powered Chat Assistant for Document Intelligence
Built a full-stack AI chat application enabling natural language querying over enterprise PDF documents stored in Azure Blob Storage, delivering intelligent, context-aware answers using OpenAI’s GPT models.

Leveraged Azure Cognitive Search with OpenAI embeddings to implement scalable, high-performance vector search, enabling semantic retrieval of relevant document chunks based on user queries.

Engineered a Python backend pipeline using Azure SDK and SearchClient to orchestrate document chunking, embedding generation, indexing, and retrieval, ensuring fast and accurate responses.

Integrated OpenAI’s Chat Completion API to generate conversational, human-like responses grounded in retrieved content, with support for streaming outputs to enhance interactivity.

Developed a real-time chat interface using ReactJS and WebSockets, enabling chunk-by-chunk streaming of assistant replies, mimicking natural conversation flow and improving user engagement.

Architected the system with modular components—embedding, indexing, retrieval, and response generation—allowing independent scaling and easy upgrades to individual services.

Ensured enterprise-grade scalability and maintainability by leveraging Azure-native services, enabling seamless integration, secure access control, and future extensibility.
